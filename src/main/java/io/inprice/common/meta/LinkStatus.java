/**
 * This class consists of several statuses that are used to manage links's
 * positions.
 *
 * The statuses below are divided into three groups: a) neutral The links
 * in this group are needed to be handled differently. NEW status, for example,
 * is the initial position. This group will be excluded from analysis and
 * reports.
 *
 * b) positive This group is used for AVAILABLE state and internal problems like
 * SOCKET_ERROR and ClASS_PROBLEM. Other than AVAILABLE state, the links
 * in this group actually have no problems. So, they are needed to be handled by
 * a developer. This group will be included in analysis and reports.
 *
 * c) negative This group is used for troubled states like UNAVAILABLE and
 * NETWORK_ERROR. The links in this group have problems in network or
 * e-commerce website. This group will be excluded from analysis and reports.
 *
 * d) user User driven links take place in this group. This group will be
 * excluded from analysis and reports.
